The latest `okta` provider for StackQL is available now (`v25.09.00341`), featuring a comprehensive reorganization of services and resources that better aligns with Okta's API structure. This update improves discoverability, logical grouping, and overall usability when working with Okta resources through StackQL.

## What's Changed

The updated Okta provider features a more granular and logical organization of services that mirrors Okta's API architecture more closely.  Here is a summary of the services included in the latest `okta` provider:

:::note

The improved organization including service and resource naming and mapping will introduce changes to queries against the previous provider version (`v23.03.00121`), you can pin the previous version in `stackql-deploy` or via `registry pull` in the interim while you make necessary query modifications.

## Enhanced Documentation

The new [__Okta Provider Docs__](https://okta-provider.stackql.io/) provide comprehensive documentation on how to use the new `okta` provider including ready-to-use SQL examples for each resource and method. A standout feature is the copy-paste functionality for all SQL queries, making it incredibly easy to:

1. **Compose Infrastructure-as-Code workflows**: Each method documentation includes working SQL examples that can be directly copied into your deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines. Simply click the copy button next to any example to get production-ready SQL code.

2. **Build analytics dashboards**: Create sophisticated cross-service queries by combining examples from different resources. The documentation's consistent query formatting makes it simple to join related data across multiple Okta services.

3. **Develop governance reports**: Copy baseline queries and customize them for your specific compliance needs. The pre-formatted SQL provides the perfect starting point for custom reporting.

## Getting Started

To start using the updated `okta` provider, simply pull the latest version from `stackql shell` or `stackql registry` command:

```sql
registry pull okta;
```

Then you can begin querying your Okta resources with SQL:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="user-group-assignments"
  values={[
    { label: 'Group assignments', value: 'user-group-assignments', },
    { label: 'User activity', value: 'user-activity', },
    { label: 'Network zones', value: 'network-zones', },
    { label: 'AuthZ servers and scopes', value: 'auth-servers-scopes', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="user-group-assignments">

```sql
-- Get all users and their group assignments
SELECT 
  u.id, 
  JSON_EXTRACT(u.profile, '$.email') as email,
  u.status, 
  JSON_EXTRACT(g.profile, '$.name') as group_name
FROM 
  okta.user.users u
JOIN 
  okta.group.users gu ON u.id = gu.user_id
JOIN 
  okta.group.groups g ON gu.group_id = g.id
WHERE subdomain = 'my-company';  
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="user-activity">

```sql
-- Report on users login and activity
SELECT
id,
activated,
created,
lastLogin,
lastUpdated,
passwordChanged,
JSON_EXTRACT(profile, '$.email') as email,
JSON_EXTRACT(profile, '$.firstName') as first_name,
JSON_EXTRACT(profile, '$.lastName') as last_name,
status,
statusChanged
FROM okta.users.users
WHERE subdomain = 'my-company';  
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="network-zones">

```sql
-- Inventory network zones for security audit
SELECT 
  name, 
  type, 
  status, 
  gateways, 
  proxies
FROM 
  okta.networkzone.zones
WHERE subdomain = 'my-company'; 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="auth-servers-scopes">

```sql
-- Review authorization servers and scopes
SELECT 
  a.name as auth_server_name,
  s.name as scope_name,
  s.description
FROM 
  okta.authorizationserver.authorizationservers a
JOIN 
  okta.authorizationserver.scopes s ON a.id = s.server_id
WHERE subdomain = 'my-company'; 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use Cases for the Okta Provider

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage your Okta resources alongside other cloud providers in a unified IaC approach, see [__`stackql-deploy`__](https://stackql-deploy.io/).

2. **Cost Optimization**: Identify unused resources and opportunities for cost savings.

3. **Security and Compliance**: Audit account roles, permissions, and access patterns to ensure compliance with security policies.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track query performance, warehouse utilization, and identify optimization opportunities.

5. **Cross-Provider Orchestration**: Build workflows that span Okta and other resource providers, enabling sophisticated data and infrastructure pipelines.

6. **Automated Reporting**: Create automated reports on Okta usage, performance, and costs.
