:::info

[__`stackql`__](https://github.com/stackql/stackql) is a dev tool that allows you to query and manage cloud and SaaS resources using SQL, which developers and analysts can use for CSPM, assurance, user access management reporting, IaC, XOps and more. 

:::

We're excited to announce the release of two new StackQL providers: **`datadog`** and **`pagerduty`**. The `daatdog` provider includes **41 services** and **405 methods** at your disposal, you can query and manage everything from APM retention filters, audit logs, to cloud workload security and more.  More information on the `dataog` provider can be found [here](https://datadog.stackql.io/providers/datadog/).  

The `pagerduty` provider includes an array of services like `events`, `metrics`, `monitors`, and `users` to fully leverage the operational prowess of these platforms. Whether it's maintaining the security posture with `cloud_workload_security` and `security_monitoring` or managing resources with `containers` and `incidents`, StackQL gives you the visibility and control over `pagerduty`, `datadog` or numerous other XaaS platforms.  More information on the `pagerduty` provider can be found [here](https://pagerduty.stackql.io/providers/pagerduty/).
